    "# Example of hyperfine quadrupole spectrum of $\\text{S}_2\\text{Cl}_2$ molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we simulate the rotational hyperfine spectrum of $\\text{S}_2\\text{Cl}_2$, including the forbidden ortho-para transitions, observed by [Kanamori], and compare with results of theoretical predictions from [Wichmann].\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperfine interaction is represented by the nuclear quadrupole coupling of the two chlorine nuclei.\n",
    "Each chlorine nucleus has a nuclear spin of $I = \\tfrac{3}{2}$ and a nuclear quadrupole moment of $Q = -81.65$ mb ($^{35}\\text{Cl}$) [Pyykkö].\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular geometry, dipole moment, and electric field gradient tensors (EFG) used in this simulation are defined in the module [s2cl2_cc.py](s2cl2_cc.py) or [s2cl2_dft.py](s2cl2_dft.py).\n",
    "\n",
